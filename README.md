# [Big Rico's Pizza](https://big-ricos-pizza.vercel.app/)

This project is a re-creation and parady of the [Domino's Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007053218/https://www.dominos.com/) in order to practice TailwindCSS and matching comps. The parody is Night Vale themed and features references to the podcast and books.

## Goals

This site was not built to be a pixel perfect recreation of the Domino's site. This project was built with the following goals in mind: 
- get experience with Tailwind CSS
- get a vague sense of what a complicated, production application might be like in regards to styles and design
- have fun

## Important Notes

- The design is based on Domnino's website from 2023 and, because of this, the Domino's website may now look very different. Please find the October 2023 Domino's site [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007053218/https://www.dominos.com/).
- The accessibility for this application could still be improved! I'm always learning. 

## Other Notes

- The app doesn't behave like the Domino's app and this is intentional
- If you notice anything that could be more Night-vale-ian, please let me know via a PR. 

### Enjoy! (Or Else!)
